# FairDivision2d

### Introduction
FairDivision2d is a program that focuses on fair division in two dimensions. It is part of a Master's thesis in Computer Science at the Open University.

### Algorithms
The program implements three algorithms for fair division:

1. Cut and Choose: This algorithm involves one player dividing the resources into pieces, and the other player choosing their desired piece. The goal is to encourage fair division.

2. The Last Diminisher: In this algorithm, the division process starts with one player dividing the resources, and the other player continuously diminishing the remaining pieces until an agreement is reached.

2. The round Algorithm: This algorithm involves one player defining a desired piece by drawing a surrounding boundary, and the other player getting the remaining resources.


### Thesis Description
The thesis involves conducting experiments with individuals who will play against each other to evaluate whether they can achieve better outcomes than those obtained using the different algorithms mentioned above. The experiments will be conducted under the following three conditions:

1. Each player knows only their own preferences and requirements.

2. The players receive guidance from the algorithm.

3. The players receive guidance from the algorithm and have access to information about each other's preferences.

The purpose of these experiments is to analyze the effectiveness and fairness of the algorithms in different scenarios and compare the results obtained.
